----------

ui-framework is designed to automatically register events according to UI naming rules. This design idea is applicable to any engine such as Unreal Engine. The current implementation is based on unity 2018.4.18 and xLua v2.1.14.

The purpose of this project is to facilitate the implementation of independent games for customers who purchase 
[CLine Action Editor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/cline-action-editor-2-163343 "CLine Action Editor 2"). If you like this project, pls support me to buy that cool skill editor!
